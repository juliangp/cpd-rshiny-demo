# Demo of RShiny app in git based projects

This repo consists of 3 folders:

1. `assets` - anything under this folder is imported as an asset (in CAMS)
2. `assettypes` - definitions of the different asset types?
3. `rshiny` - all files that are not under `assets` or `assettypes`
   will be imported as a code package
